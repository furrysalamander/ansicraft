# Dockerized Minecraft RTSP Stream
###### Yes, this really is as dumb as it sounds.

## How to get started
* Run the provided `launch.sh` script to start both Minecraft client and server containers:
    ```bash
    $ ./launch.sh
    ```
* Alternatively, specify a custom Minecraft server address:
    ```bash
    $ ./launch.sh my-minecraft-server.example.com
    ```
* Connect to the Minecraft terminal via SSH on port 9867:
    ```bash
    $ ssh -p 9867 localhost
    ```
* Play Minecraft directly in your terminal window!
* Question your decisions in life that brought you to this moment.
